# TMNT_Dojo
Strictly for fun, I am making a fighting game with TMNT characters in Express, Node, and Javascript. Version 1.0
The object of this project is to perform CRUD using JSON and a restful API. 
I have built a small JSON database of turtle objects, each with their own unique attributes and methods
You will pick a character and try to survive three battles against the other characters, one by one. 
Each time you pick an action to take, an API call will send and retrieve data, manipulating the character objects in some way. 
Good luck, ninja. 
Booyakasha!
